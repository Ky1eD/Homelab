<br />
Next you need to shrink part of your drive to be able to install the OS and any files you need for it. I chose to give it 200gb, because I don't exatctly know what Im going to use it for yet but you should give it atleast 40gb of space:  <br/>

<br />
After you do that plug in the USB drive and restart and go into BIOS:  <br/>
