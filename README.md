Firstly I downloaded the OSI File for Windows Server 2016. To get a copy of Windows Server you have to fill out some information that Microsoft requires: <br/>

<br />
<br />
Then I created a VM in Virtual Box which you can see my guide here: <br/>

<br />
<br />
Now you need to create a username, password and hostname:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Then you have to configure the ammount of hardware you want to use for the VM. I chose 4 cpu cores and 8gb of ram because my computer has the resources to allow me to do so and I prefer to have fast snappy VMs: <br/>

<br />
<br />
Now you have to create a virtual hard disk. I don't plan on storing a lot of data on this VM if at all so im going to stick to the default:  <br/>

<br />
Lastly You can finish making the VM:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Make the USB drive your first boot option and turn off secure boot:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
After you do that plug in the USB drive and restart and go into BIOS:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Then save it then leave bios to boot into the Kali Linux Install and go through the install proccess:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Lastly after installing the OS you wanted to dual boot into take out the USB drive and then you are all done:  <br/>
